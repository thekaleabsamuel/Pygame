Hello I made a game titled "Running Through The City" using pygame + python

You play as a main character collecting coins and brownie powerups while avoiding and defeating birds

At the end of the game a screen pops up that lets the player enter their name and their score is saved into a database

All Assets were designed / custom by myself using a mixture of different programs such as dall-e 2, dall-e 3, midjourney, illustrator and more
